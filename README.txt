Question: 1
Given an undirected graph with V nodes and E edges, create and return an adjacency list of the graph. 0-based indexing is followed everywhere.
Examples: (Should not use the examples to submit your code. These examples are for your understanding)
Input:
V = 4, E = 4
edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3], [3,0]]

Output: 
[[1,3], [0,2], [1,3], [2,0]]
Explanation:
Node 0 is connected to 1 and 3.
Node 1 is connected to 0 and 2.
Node 2 is connected to 1 and 3.
Node 3 is connected to 2 and 0.
